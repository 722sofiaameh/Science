			<h3>Neuclophiles</h3>
			Neuclophiles are molecules having atoms with high electron density.They are electron rich and therefore electron donor.The can donate electrons because they are electron sufficient.They have unshaired electron pair that they can use in covalent bond formation.

			<h3>Neucleophilic Reagents</h3>
			This are negatively charged reagents,they seek the nuecleus.

<h3>Electrophiles</h3>
<p>
	This are molecules having atoms with low electron density.They are electron acceptors and they are electron deficient.

	<h3>Electrophilic Reagents</h3>
	This are reagents that are positively charge speciecs they seek electrons.
<div>
	The kind of reaction which occurs between a Nucleophile and Electrophile is known as <strong>Co-ordinate Covalent Bonding.</strong>

<h4>Examples of Aromatic Substitution reaction of benzene below;</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Nitration</li>
	<li>Sulphonation</li>
	<li>Halogenation</li>
	<li>Friedel-Crafts Alkylation</li>
	<li>Friedel-Crafts Acylation</li>
</ol>
<h4>Increase rate of substitution by neucleophiles</h4>
The least reactive is <strong>RF</strong> and the most reactive is <strong>RI</strong> Iodine has the weakest bonds to carbon and therefore Iodine is the best leaving group.
Among the Alkyl Halides,Alkyl Iodides undergo neucleophilic substitution at the fastest rate and alkyl fluoride,the slowest rate.
<div>
<strong> *RI </strong>are several times more reactive than RBr and RCl.

<h4>Note:</h4>

<p>
Leaving group ability is also related to basicity.A strongly basic anion is usually a poorer living group than a weakly basic one.
<ol>
	<li>Fluroide is the most basic and poorest living group among the halide anions.</li>
	<li>Iodine is the least basic and best living group among the halide anions.</li>
</ol>
